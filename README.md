## 📘 Project Overview
This project integrates **Snowflake Cloud Data Warehouse** with **Power BI** to analyze climatic factors and their impact on crop yield across different regions and seasons.  
The analysis covers **Rainfall, Temperature, Humidity, and Yield trends** from 2000–2020, enabling insights into how weather patterns influence agricultural productivity.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze **average rainfall, temperature, and humidity** over time.  
- Study **crop-wise and region-wise yield variations**.  
- Identify high-performing regions and crop combinations.  
- Create a unified **cloud-powered dashboard** for agricultural monitoring.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Snowflake** | Cloud-based data storage and query processing |
| **Power BI** | Data modeling, visualization, and reporting |
| **SQL** | Data extraction and aggregation |
| **Power Query** | Data cleaning and transformation |
| **Excel** | Dataset preparation and reference sheets |

---

## 🧩 Data Preparation
- Data stored and queried in **Snowflake**.  
- Power BI connected directly via **Snowflake connector** for live updates.  
- Power Query used for:
  - Renaming inconsistent columns  
  - Handling missing climatic data  
  - Creating calculated columns for seasonal averages  

---

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

### ☔ Rainfall Analysis
- Yearly and seasonal rainfall patterns (Rabi, Kharif, Zaid)
- Crop-wise rainfall averages (Paddy, Tea, Coffee, Ginger)
- Regional comparison (Bangalore, Raichur, Kodagu, Mangalore)

### 🌡️ Temperature Analysis
- Seasonal and crop-based temperature fluctuations
- Heat map visualizations for regional temperature differences

### 💧 Humidity Analysis
- Stable humidity levels across regions and seasons
- Comparison between high-humidity and low-humidity crop zones

### 🌾 Yield Analysis
- Crop yield by season and location
- Top 10 high-yield crops (Cotton, Coconut, Ginger, Tea, etc.)
- Correlation between weather conditions and yield outcomes

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Kodagu and Mysuru** show consistently high yields due to balanced rainfall and moderate temperatures.  
- **Cotton and Coconut** recorded the highest productivity in recent years.  
- **Rainfall stability** directly influenced yield efficiency in Rabi and Kharif seasons.  
- Cloud integration via **Snowflake** ensured efficient and scalable data refresh.

---

## 🧠 Learnings
- Hands-on experience connecting **Power BI to Snowflake** using direct query mode.  
- Improved understanding of **climate–agriculture relationships** through data visualization.  
- Enhanced DAX and Power Query skills for multi-dimensional analysis.
